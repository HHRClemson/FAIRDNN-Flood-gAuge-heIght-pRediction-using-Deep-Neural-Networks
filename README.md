# Supervised-Variational-Encoding
This project is about developing A Generalized Locally Linear Factorization
Machine with Supervised Variational Encoding. See the main paper here https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8661534 
Data: MNIST Dataset: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
For time series data we will use US river discharge data available here https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html
